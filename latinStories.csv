Crustula Coquere,Baking Cookies,monologue,A1,"Panem dulcem facere volo. In culina sum. Hic mensa est, hic patella est. Farinam capio et in patellam pono. Ova frango et cum farina misceo. Butyrum et mel addo. Omnia bene misceo. Nunc patellam in furnum pono. Furnus calidus est. Exspecto paulisper. Odor dulcis venit. Ego gaudeo. Nunc patellam ex furno capio. Crustula parva sunt. Crustula calida sunt. Dente edo crustulum. Crustulum dulce est, bene sapit. Vita bona est.","I want to make sweet bread. I am in the kitchen. Here is the table, here is the plate. I take the flour and put it in the plate. I break the eggs and mix them with the flour. I add the butter and honey. I mix everything well. Now I put the plate in the oven. The oven is hot. I wait a little. A sweet smell comes. I am happy. Now I take the plate out of the oven. The cookies are small. The cookies are hot. I eat the cookie with my teeth. The cookie is sweet, it tastes good. Life is good."

Cubiculum Meum Purgare,Cleaning My Room,monologue,A1,"Hodie cubiculum meum purgo. Multa sunt in mensa et in terra. Librum in librarium pono. Mensa stercoribus plena est; omnia aufero. In angulo saccus vestimentorum iacet. Vestimenta in armarium mitto. Sub mensa panis vetus est; illum in canistrum iacio. Aqua parva est in poculo; eam effundo. Postea fenestram aperio. Aer novus intrat, et bene mihi est. Nunc cubiculum meum est purum et clarum.","Today I am cleaning my room. There are many things on the table and on the floor. I put the book on the bookshelf. The table is full of rubbish; I take it all away. In the corner lies a sack of clothes. I put the clothes in the cupboard. There is old bread under the table; I throw it in the basket. There is a little water in the cup; I pour it out. Then I open the window. Fresh air comes in, and I feel good. Now my room is clean and bright."

Nova Vocabula Discere,Learning New Vocabulary,monologue,A1,"Discipuli, verba nova discere semper necesse est. Cum novum verbum audio, in mente mea ponere conor. Primum verbum lego, deinde scribo, et iterum dico voce clara. Sic memoria me iuvat. Saepius verba cum amicis exerceo: ego dico, ille respondet, et simul ridemus. Si verbum obliviscor, non despero, sed iterum legere et audire tempto. Nonnulla verba cum picturis coniungo: si verbum est “aqua,” imaginem aquae in mente video. Si verbum est “canis,” statim animal in via recordor. Quo plura verba disco, eo facilius fabulas intellego et novas sententias facere possum. Vita discipuli difficilis est, sed bene studere me delectat. Verba nova mihi viam aperiunt ad litteras, ad historias, ad mundum totum.","Students, it is always necessary to learn new words. When I hear a new word, I try to keep it in my mind. First I read the word, then I write it, and then I say it again out loud. This helps my memory. I often practice words with friends: I say it, he answers, and we laugh together. If I forget a word, I don’t despair, but I try to read and listen to it again. I associate some words with pictures: if the word is “water,” I see an image of water in my mind. If the word is “dog,” I immediately remember the animal on the road. The more words I learn, the easier I understand stories and can make new sentences. The life of a student is difficult, but studying well makes me happy. New words open the way for me to literature, to stories, to the whole world."

Urbs Mea Optima,My Favorite City,monologue,A1,"Urbs mihi maxima placet Roma. Roma antiqua et magna est. Multae viae rectae sunt et multae aedes altae sunt. In foro homines semper laborant et loquuntur. Templi multa sunt ubi dei coluntur. In viis ego ambulo et multas res video. Aqua in fontibus clara est, et pueri in viis ludunt. Roma habet muros magnos et portas altas. In urbe sunt theatra ubi populus spectat fabulas. Ego amo Romam quod plena est vitae et historiae. Roma est urbs mea optima.","The city I like the most is Rome. Rome is ancient and great. There are many straight roads and many tall buildings. In the forum people are always working and talking. There are many temples where the gods are worshipped. I walk along the streets and see many things. The water in the fountains is clear, and children play in the streets. Rome has great walls and high gates. There are theaters in the city where people watch plays. I love Rome because it is full of life and history. Rome is my best city."
